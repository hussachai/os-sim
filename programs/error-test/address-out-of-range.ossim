;This system has memory 0-4095
;The memory address register has 1 word size (12 bits)
;The direct addressing mode can cover all memory that system has
;However, we can use indexing addressing mode to add the value of R4
;to the value of PC+instruction(6,11).
;Unfortunately, we cannot raise the memory out of bound because
;The result of adding cannot hold in 1 word size, the arithmetic 
;error is raise instead.
