;Operating supports signed integer type (12 bits)
;It can store number from -2048 to 2047
;This program will add 1 to 2047 and see the result

;The result should be -2048 because it's too complicated to
;implement bound checking for number in 2's complement 
;Doing that will cause the performance issue by spending
;too much CPU cycle. The operating system should hand this responsibility
;to the application. The C and Java language also get the same result.
